Overview
This repository contains a micro-credentialing project utilizing blockchain technology. It includes smart contracts, front-end integration, and related scripts to manage and verify credentials using Ethereum. The setup involves Truffle for smart contract management and Ganache for a local blockchain simulation.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

Node.js (version 12.x or later)
npm (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
Truffle (npm install -g truffle)
Ganache (available at Ganache)

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/micro-credentialing.git
cd micro-credentialing
Install Dependencies

sh
Copy code
npm install
Run Ganache
Open Ganache and start a new workspace. Make sure it runs on the default port (7545).

Compile Contracts

sh
Copy code
truffle compile
Migrate Contracts

sh
Copy code
truffle migrate --network development
Run Tests

sh
Copy code
truffle test
Launch the Front-end
Open index.html in your browser to interact with the DApp.

Configuration
The Truffle configuration file truffle-config.js is pre-configured for a local development network:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*", // Match any network id
    },
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.0", // Fetch exact version from solc-bin
    },
  },
};
Usage
Deploying Contracts
After setting up Ganache, compile and migrate your contracts to the local blockchain using:

sh
Copy code
truffle migrate
Interacting with Contracts
The front-end code in index.html and script.js will interact with the deployed smart contract. Make sure to update the contract address and ABI in script.js if necessary.
